Hello everyone, this is your instructor here with a short introduction on creating your first web page. As you can see, I replaced "Page Title" to my name and now I'm replacing Hello World! with this short paragraph. My next step is to click File and Save As - introHTML_lastname.html. Then I will upload this file to my GitHub webspace.
