    <main>
    <p>This page is meant to help you practice using relational selectors. There are four main types of relational selectors</p>
        <h3>Four Relational Selectors</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>Descendant</li>
    <li>Adjacent Sibiling</li>
    <li>Child</li>
    <li>General Sibline</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Relational selectors work differently than more common selectors used in CSS.<p>
    <h2>Common CSS Selectors</h2>
    <p>There are three common types of selectors used with CSS.</p>
    <ul>
    <li>HTML elements</li>
    <li>ID</li>
    <li>Class</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>In addition to relational selectors and common selectors, there is one last type of selector, the All Elements selector. The All Elements selector applies a style to all HTML elements in a webpage and it uses an asterisk.</p>
   
    </main>
    
    <footer>
    <p>Relational selectors make it easier to apply CSS to different HTML elements without having to write code for each element or include a large number of IDs and Classes.</p>
